#War
This is a single player game to simulate the card game of war. I forked the starter from a fellow classmate at Nashville Software School, but I wrote all of the code myself.

#Usage
Follow these instructions:

  1. In the command line, type ```git clone https://github.com/danielcossins11/war.git```
  2. cd into the lib directory
  3. run the command ```npm install```
  4. run the command ```bower install```
  5. ```cd ..```
  6. run the command ```http-server ./```
  7. go to your ip address in your web browser
