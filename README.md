#War
This is a single player game to simulate the card game of war. I forked the starter from a fellow classmate at Nashville Software School, but I wrote all of the code myself.

#Usage
Follow these instructions:
<ul>
  <li>In the command line, type "git clone https://github.com/danielcossins11/war.git"</li>
  <li>cd into the lib directory</li>
  <li>run the command "npm install"</li>
  <li>run the command "bower install"</li>
  <li>"cd .."</li>
  <li>run the command "http-server ./"</li>
</ul>
